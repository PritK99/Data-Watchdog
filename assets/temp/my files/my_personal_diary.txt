I live in Jelum Towers, Vice City, 400809, and I go by Sonny. I had an amazing drive through Vice City's neon-lit streets before heading to the storied Malibu Club for an exciting night of music that will never be forgotten. I'm constantly in awe of the city's breathtaking skyline and lively nightlife. Lance Vance, a buddy of mine, will see me shortly to discuss a mission. He is employed with The Dockyards. Using the IP address 172.182.99.1, he emailed me about the mission using the email address lancevance@gmail.com. A message from +919999999999 reached me as well. It appears to be authentic.

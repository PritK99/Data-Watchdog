# Research

For PII data detection, there can be two ways PII data might be available in databases. One is in structured format, that is the column names, JSON or SQL dumps. For eg. a csv having column of date of birth. Other can be textual fields. Here, we need to identify PII data in the text. This includes .pdf, .txt, .log etc. Unstructured data also includes multimedia like video and images.

## Structured Data

Pending work.

## Unstructured Data

### Textual files

Here we deal with types such as .pdf, .txt, .log etc. We use NER and regex to identify PII among them. 

### Multimedia

This is a future scope for now.
